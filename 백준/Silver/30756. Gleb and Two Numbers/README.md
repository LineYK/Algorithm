### 문제 설명

<p>When Gleb is not busy with writing long problem statements he enjoys playing with numbers. He picks two integers $l$ and $r$ and tries to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $l \le a \le b ≤ r$ and the Hamming distance between $a$ and $b$ is maximum possible.</p>

<p>The <em>Hamming distance</em> between two integers $x$ and $y$ is defined as the number of decimal places at which they are different. If these integers are of different length, the shorter one is prepended with leading zeroes.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $l$ and the second line contains a single integer $r$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{1\,000\,000}$).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print the maximum possible Hamming distance between a pair of integers in range from $l$ to $r$.</p>
